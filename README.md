# Final-Eclipse
Hi! this is a quick note before using my first theme.
This was only ment for vencord (https://vencord.dev). it will also work in better discord, too. I just dont use better discord so i cant help you on that.
Its mainly a focus on the background, All the other stuff isnt **needed** its just to make the UI a bit more fresh

# How to install theme.
Yeah, its pretty easy.
First up, you want to download the theme, if you dont know where to find the theme, use this link: [https://github.com/raws-robert/Final-Eclipse/main/finaleclipse.theme.css] The download button should be by the top of the file.
Open file explorer and go to downloads, and copy the downloaded css file.
Now, find your way to discord and then go to your user settings and find the Vencord section, then click themes.

Next up in the top, click Local Themes. This is a local theme!
If your on the discord website it should say "Import Theme", Else it should say "Open Themes Folder", Click on which ever button is on your screen. and just click Ctrl + V.
You should have the discord theme imported, now just enable it! If you have any issues, or questions, anything like that. my Discord is @jarfix0
