# Final-Eclipse
Hi! this is a quick note before using my first theme.
This was only ment for vencord (https://vencord.dev). it will also work in better discord, too. I just dont use better discord so i cant help you on that.
Its mainly a focus on the background, All the other stuff isnt **needed** its just to make the UI a bit more fresh
